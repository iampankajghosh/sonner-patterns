Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my little playground for toast notifications. I've been experimenting with Sonner (which is awesome, btw) and wanted to create a collection of really nice toast patterns that you can actually use in your projects.

This isn't just another component library - it's more like a sketchbook of toast ideas that I've found useful while building real applications. Some are simple, some are fancy, but they all work great!
